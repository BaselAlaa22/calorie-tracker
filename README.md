My Calorie Tracker Learning Project
Welcome to my Calorie Tracker learning project! This repository documents my exploration and hands-on experience with fundamental React concepts while building a Calorie Tracker application. If you're a fellow learner or someone interested in seeing the progression of my React skills, you've come to the right place.

Learning Focus:
1. State Management:
Embark on my journey of understanding React state management by exploring how to create and update state variables within the context of a Calorie Tracker application. Witness my growth as I learn to dynamically manage and display calorie data.

2. CSS Variables:
Join me in discovering the power of CSS variables as I enhance the styling of my Calorie Tracker application. Follow along as I figure out how to customize the look and feel of components with reusable CSS variables.

3. Component Building:
Experience my process of learning to build modular and reusable components for my Calorie Tracker. Dive into the journey of adopting best practices to efficiently manage calorie entries within a React application.

4. CSS Modules:
See how I leverage CSS modules to gain scoped styling benefits in my Calorie Tracker components. Watch as I navigate the challenges of keeping styles encapsulated and avoiding global conflicts while managing calorie entries.

5. State Passing:
Follow my exploration of passing state between React components within the context of a Calorie Tracker. Witness the learning curve as I experiment with different techniques to manage and share calorie data across the application.

6. Event Handling:
Join me in delving into event handling within React components for the Calorie Tracker. Share in the excitement as I learn to capture and respond to user interactions, making my Calorie Tracker interactive and user-friendly.

Getting Started:
